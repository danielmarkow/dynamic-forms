# Dynamic Forms for Master Data Management
## Goal
Migrated from [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/danielmarkow/react-dynamic-forms/src/master/)   

This is supposed to be Google Forms that you can host yourself with a stronger emphasis on master data management - especially in the context of BI and analytics. Form validation should be extensively configurable so that the data entered in a form results in valid master data. On the backend the data should be easily extracted. 
## TODO
- implement configuration form validation (X)
- implement configurable validation for generated input elements ( )
